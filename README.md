# Water_Quality_Prediction_RTSGAN-GNN-LSTM
Forecasting of water quality data (water temperature and dissolved oxygen) at three hydrological stations in Serbia. Additionally, RTSGAN is used to augment the dataset with synthetic data. It is then checked how and whether the additional data affect the prediction models (GNN and LSTM).
